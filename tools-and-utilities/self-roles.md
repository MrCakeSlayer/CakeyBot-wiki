# Self Roles/Reaction Roles

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure that Cakey Bot has the **`Manage Roles`** permission and that the Cakey Bot's role is _above_ the roles it is trying to assign.
{% endhint %}

## Self Role Command

Self Roles allows users to add/remove roles to/from themselves from a list of roles that have been created/set by the server admins.

To add/remove a role from this list you can use the `/selfrole add <role>` and `/selfrole remove <role>` commands.

To list all roles that can be self-assigned you can use the `/selfrole list` command.

After you have added some roles to the self role list you \(and your users\) can add/remove the roles from yourself using the `/selfrole use <role>` and `/selfrole unuse <role>` commands.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to use any of our advanced self-assign methods \(like buttons, reactions or selection dropdowns\) you will need to create a self-role embed using the `/selfrole embed` command. This will generate an embed using the assignment method you set on our web dashboard.
