# Command Info

### Command Help

Cakey Bot has a huge collection of commands and features. We are also constantly adding new features and content. In order to keep an up-to-date and accurate command list, we have decided to keep a central list/page for all of our commands. You can access this full page of commands [here](https://cakeybot.app/commands.html).

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also access command usage/help directly in discord using the `/help <cmd>` command. This command will show usage, parameters, aliases and a command description for any command you pass as an argument.
{% endhint %}

### Slash Commands

Cakey Bot makes use of Discord's slash command system. Slash commands will prompt you for arguments/parameters if they are required and some will send "ephemerally", meaning that the results are only shown to you. This means that you can use some slash commands without spamming the chat for everyone else!

### Custom Commands

You can set custom commands alongside Cakey Bot's default commands. For more information on how to do this, check out the [custom command section](../tools-and-utilities/custom-commands.md).
